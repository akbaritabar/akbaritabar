I am going to misuse the perfect ideas Github has already added to get me started with the readme! :)


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a postdoctoral researcher on themes related (but not limited) to __science of science__, __social networks__, __collaboration networks__, and of course __computational social science__.
- ðŸŒ± I never get tired of learning!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research ideas close to above themes, using computational tools and techniques to answer _social scientific_ questions.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter: @akbaritabar, [@Akbaritabar@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@Akbaritabar) or email!
