### Hi there 👋

I am Ali. I am going to misuse the perfect ideas Github has already added to get me started with the readme! :)


- 🔭 I’m currently working as a postdoctoral researcher on themes related (but not limited) to __science of science__, __social networks__, __collaboration networks__, and of course __computational social science__.
- 🌱 I never get tired of learning!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research ideas close to above themes, using computational tools and techniques to answer _social scientific_ questions.
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter: @akbaritabar or email!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
